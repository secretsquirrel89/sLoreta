# sLoreta

sLoreta is a signal filter designed for EEG signals, for the use of biofeedback. This project is an open source implementation of an sLoreta filter in Javascript. 

## Goals 

1. Create an sLoreta filter with 3D vector representation
2. Reproject the real-time brain localization activity from the sLoreta on to a 3D virtual brain
3. Z-score normalization for the real-time brain localization activity
4. Reproject the real-time brain localization activity with sLoreta and Z-score normalization onto a 3D virtual brain
